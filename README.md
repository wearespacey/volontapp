# VolontApp - Glue

## Introduction
Glue helps [Child Focus](http://childfocus.be) to connect with their volunteers. At the beginning of the development, Child Focus told us that they were actually contacting volunteers based on a list of phone numbers. As this technique is not effecient enough, time and resource consuming, they wanted to automate it. They called for help at the [Hack In The Woods 2019](https://hackinthewoods.be/en) and we answered!

## What is it?
Glue is a system divided in three different layers : the clients, the API and the database.

It has different goals such as :
> helping coordinators and administrators easily contact volunteers
> track missing child posters to be able to remove them whenever the child is found

## How is it?
### Mobile app

* display missing child cases
* visualize posters and thumbnails position on a map
